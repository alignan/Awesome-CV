\lettersection{About Me}
I'm Antonio, an Engineer and developer gone the Manager way.

My background revolves around Internet of Things (IoT) solutions and projects, but as this is a broader term encompassing backend, frontend, middleware, hardware and others components from different layers, stacks and technologies to make end to end solutions happen, I'm confident I will be able to find joy and exciting new things to learn across any domain, thus I'm seeking opportunities and challenges not restricted only to my comfort zone.

I have worn several hats in the past (Project Manager, Product Owner, Developer, etc.), whoever being a People Manager is the role that has given me the greatest satisfactions in my professional career, as it has allowed me to meet great people (and friends) and to contribute to their professional and personal development, whilst improving myself with every new learnings and challenges.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I'm an experienced technical manager, a servant leader, who builds confidence and trust in his team, and strives to bring the best of every individual to grow stronger and better.  I have experience managing high-performance multidisciplinary teams (field engineers, linux engineers,full-stack developers, etc.), bringing both waterfall and agile concepts to provide visibility and clear understanding of the objectives to stakeholders.

My approach to managing a team is to manage people: each with different needs and strengths which contributes to a wider success.  My experience revolves around coaching, mentoring and helping my team members to develop both professionally and personally, towards removing blockers and building confident, reliable and highly engaged employees to ultimately deliver better and passionated work.

As my engineering and development background goes, I like to be involved in the team's development by being able to take on testing and building what the team is developing and releasing, to be aware of any possible bottleneck and support whereas needed.  I also normally like to work on small features, or at least review pull requests mainly to understand how our development process is working, and to keep myself updated.

I have a proven track of delivering complex technical solutions in complex projects, usually requiring both outside-the-box thinking, and maintaining a balance between operational and technical constraints.  To me, technology is a mean to solve a problem, not the problem to solve, or the solution by itself.  I am capable to not only provide the best technical solution to solve a problem, but the complete path to the solution: specifications, data analysis, timing and effort estimation, planning, design for testing, testing automation, packaging and documentation.
