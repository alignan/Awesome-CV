\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I'm an Engineer with wide experience in designing and delivering end-to-end industrial and consumer solutions, skilled in product management and leading multidisciplinary technical teams.  I bring the best of both technical and business worlds to create feasible and scalable solutions and deliver business outcomes.

\lettersection{Why Native Instruments?}
Native Instruments embraces creativity and excellence, and bring interesting challenges (software and hardware wise) towards delivering passionated products for passionate people: this is my ideal working environment - one with a clear correlation between the effort to design, develop and launch a product, and its active and vibrant community of users, eager to build new experiences and music.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I'm an experienced technical manager, a servant leader, who builds confidence and trust in his team, and strives to bring the best of every individual to grow stronger and better.  I have experience managing high-performance multidisciplinary teams (field engineers, embedded and full-stack developers), bringing both waterfall and agile concepts to provide visibility and clear understanding of the objectives to stakeholders.

My approach to managing a team is to manage people: each with different needs and strengths which contributes to a wider success.  My experience revolves around coaching, mentoring and building up career and personal development plans for my reportees, towards removing blockers and building confident, reliable and highly engaged employees to ultimately deliver better and passionated work.

I have a proven track of delivering complex technical solutions in complex projects, usually requiring both outside-the-box thinking, and maintaining a balance between operational and technical constraints.  To me, technology is a mean to solve a problem, not the problem to solve, or the solution by itself.  I am capable to not only provide the best technical solution to solve a problem, but the complete path to the solution: specifications, data analysis, timing and effort estimation, planning, design for testing, testing automation, packaging and documentation.
